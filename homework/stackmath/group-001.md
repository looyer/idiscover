Let $G=\{e,r,r^2,...,r^7,s,rs,...,r^7s\}$    
and condition $sr=r^3s \Rightarrow$ $sr^n=r^3sr^{n-1}=...=r^{3n}s$    
we can calculate all element order     
$|r| = |r^3| = |r^5| = |r^7| = 8$   
$|r^2| = |r^6| = |rs| = |r^3s| = |r^5s| = |r^7s| = 4$    
$|r^4| = |s| = |r^2s| = |r^4s| = |r^6s| = 2$  
and $|e| = 1$   
all order-4 group element is in $\{e, r^4, s, r^2s, r^4s, r^6s\}$   
simple calculate we can  found other group is    
$\{e, r^2s, r^4, r^6s\}$
